Writing Good Programs--
I make programs easy to read by giving things clear names, writing comments, and keeping the code neat. When I made the CRUD Python module for Project One, it helped me connect the dashboard to the database in Project Two. It made the work faster and easier. I can use the CRUD module again if I need to work with a database later.

Solving Problems--
When I get a problem, I break it into small steps and solve one step at a time. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I planned out how the database and dashboard would work before I started. In older projects, I would just start coding without thinking much. Now, I plan better, test my code more, and make sure it helps the user. I will keep doing it this way in the future.

Why Computer Science Matters--
Computer scientists solve problems with technology. My project helped Grazioso Salvare by making it easier for them to find and organize information about their dogs. Good programs help companies work faster and better.
